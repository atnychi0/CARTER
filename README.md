# CARTER
Comprehensive Genealogical History of the Carter–Smith Line

This document integrates both paternal Carter ancestry and maternal Smith ancestry, providing a continuous genealogical record from medieval England through colonial Virginia, into Alabama, Georgia, and forward to the present-day descendants. It expands upon previous records with additional narrative detail, historical context, and explanatory notes to provide a fuller picture of both lineages.

Part I. Carter Family Line (Paternal)

Medieval and English Origins

The Carter surname arose as an occupational name in medieval England, describing a cart driver or transporter of goods. By the 14th century it had stabilized into hereditary use. Records from Hertfordshire show a consistent Carter presence:

John/Thomas Carter (~1340s–1350s, Hertfordshire) — earliest likely ancestor in manorial rolls; lived in the aftermath of the Black Death when English surnames became standardized.

Richard Carter (~1370s–1380s, Hertfordshire) — appears in 14th‑century poll tax records, establishing continuity in the family’s presence in Hertfordshire.

William Carter (~1400s, Hertfordshire) — found in late medieval parish and manorial references, likely a free tenant with land obligations.

John Carter (~1460s, Hertfordshire) — documented through parish entries in the early Tudor era; this generation marks a more settled line.

William Carter (~1490s, Hertfordshire) — associated with parish register generations, linking into early Tudor England.

Robert Carter (~1520s, Hertfordshire) — stands at the transition from medieval to Tudor England, anchoring the family firmly in Hertfordshire.

Thomas Carter (~1550s, Hertfordshire; d. early 1600s) — gentleman farmer, marking upward mobility of the line.

John Carter (1584–1669, Hertfordshire) — married Bridget Benion; his line directly produced the Virginia immigrant Captain Thomas Carter.

Colonial Virginia Carters

Captain Thomas Carter Sr. of Corotoman (1630–1700) — emigrated from Hertfordshire to Virginia. Married Katherine Dale, the daughter of a prominent family. Established the Corotoman estate, becoming a foundational patriarch of the American Carter family.

Thomas Carter II (1672–1733) — son, inherited substantial Virginia holdings, maintained Carter prominence.

Alexander Carter (late 1600s–early 1700s) — next in line, extending the family estate.

John Carter (b. ~1725) — documented in mid‑18th century Virginia.

James Nathan Carter — bridged the 18th to 19th century.

Ira Clifton Carter — continued the line into the 1800s.

Clifton Carter — 19th–20th century ancestor.

Juanita Marie Carter (later Reeves) — grandmother, who carried forward both Carter heritage and merged with Reeves family ties.

Luanne Reeves — daughter of Juanita.

Brendon Joseph Kelly — present descendant.

Estate Anchors

Corotoman Estate (Lancaster County, Virginia) — Captain Thomas Carter’s original American stronghold.

Pampatike Plantation (1744 onward under Carter control) — a Carter estate that remained influential into the 19th century, confirming the prominence of this branch.

Part II. Smith Family Line (Maternal)

First Generation: Orange Smith

Orange Smith (b. ~1800, Georgia; d. 1851)

Parents: Joseph Smith and Zibiah Culbreath.

Married Fatha Terry in Walton County, Georgia, July 17, 1828.

Established the family’s Georgia roots during the antebellum era.

Second Generation: George Molton Smith Sr.

George Molton Smith Sr. (son of Orange).

Married Patsyan Louisa Smith.

Lived in Walton County, Georgia. Later generations began to move into Alabama, part of a larger 19th‑century migration of families seeking farmland.

Third Generation: Thomas "Tom" Smith

Thomas “Tom” Smith (1854–1926).

Born in Walton County, Georgia; died in Jefferson County, Alabama.

Parents: George Molton Smith Sr. and Patsyan Louisa Smith.

Married Elizabeth Tanner Smith (1845–1884).

Buried at Mount Pinson Cemetery, Jefferson County, Alabama.

His life represented the transition of the Smith family from Georgia roots into Alabama residency.

Fourth Generation: Children of Thomas and Elizabeth

Wiley Monroe Smith (1875–1956) — married Minnie White; lived in Alabama before relocating to California; World War I draft card confirms his birth details.

Della Smith Minyard (1880–1972) — married William A. Minyard; lived a long life, noted in both census and cemetery records.

Calvin Alonzo “Lonnie” Smith (1884–1917) — mentioned in family obituaries, died relatively young.

Sallie Smith Pennwell (1876–1955) — lived into the mid‑20th century.

Parthena Smith (1870–1890) — died at age 20, marking one of the early losses in the family line.

Fifth Generation: Children of Wiley Monroe Smith & Minnie White

Anna M. Carter (née Smith) (1907–1972) — married into the Carter family, bridging the Smith and Carter lines.

John Roland Smith (1914–1966) — resided in Alabama, died relatively young.

Monroe Smith (b. 1918) — appeared in 1940 census records as living in Los Angeles, California, showing migration westward.

Charles Emmett Smith — resided in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the industrial heart of the South.

Carl Smith — moved to Los Angeles, California, symbolizing further westward expansion of the family.

Mrs. F. L. Walker — resided in Los Angeles, maintaining family ties there.

Part III. Integration

The Carter and Smith families converge in Juanita Marie Carter (later Reeves). Her paternal line stems from centuries‑old Carter ancestry tied to estates like Corotoman and Pampatike in Virginia. Her maternal line descends from Orange Smith of Georgia through Thomas “Tom” Smith and Wiley Monroe Smith of Alabama, a family that migrated westward by the early 20th century.

This integration shows not only genealogical continuity but also a broader narrative: the Carters exemplify colonial Virginia planter families, while the Smiths illustrate the migration of Southern farmers from Georgia to Alabama and eventually to California. Together, they create a story of land, movement, endurance, and adaptation.

Conclusion

This unified genealogy now presents a continuous and expanded lineage that stretches over seven centuries.

Carters — From medieval Hertfordshire, rooted in manorial life, to colonial Virginia’s landed gentry, maintaining prominence through Corotoman and Pampatike, and finally to Juanita Carter and her descendants.

Smiths — From early 1800s Georgia with Orange Smith, through farming communities in Alabama, and into Los Angeles by the mid‑20th century, leaving a trail documented by censuses, obituaries, and cemetery records.

Both lines converge in Juanita Marie Carter, symbolizing the union of two distinct but equally resilient family stories. The Carter heritage anchors in the estates and records of Virginia, while the Smith line reveals a migration pattern emblematic of many Southern families. The Reeves line further intertwines, and through Juanita’s descendants, including Brendon Joseph Kelly, these legacies remain living and traceable today.
